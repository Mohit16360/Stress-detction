# Stress Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting stress levels in humans using Machine Learning and Image Processing techniques. It aims to provide an efficient, non-invasive system capable of identifying stress through facial expressions, thermal data, and physiological signals, including data from wearable sensors.

## 🔍 Features

- Real-time stress detection
- Facial image analysis using deep learning
- Integration of multimodal data (e.g., thermal, heart rate)
- Streamlit dashboard for visualization
- Built using explainable AI approaches

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
